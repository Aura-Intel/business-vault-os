## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-01-05 | 3 tiers, not 5 | Simpler to sell, covers spectrum |
| 2024-01-10 | Names: Audit/Optimize/Transform | Clear progression, action-oriented |
| 2024-01-15 | Include training in Tier 2+ | Differentiator from competitors |

---

## Open Decisions

1. **Time commitment per tier** - Need to estimate hours
2. **Scope boundaries** - What explicitly NOT included?
3. **Add-ons** - Should there be optional add-ons?

---

## Dependencies

### This Project Depends On:
- None (foundational)

### This Project Blocks:
- [[Pricing Strategy]] - Cannot price without defined services
- [[Proposal Template]] - Cannot template without service details

---
