## Morning Routine (15 mins)

### 1. Open Your Vault

Launch Obsidian + Claude Code in your vault directory.

### 2. Initialize

```
Initialize
```

Wait for:
- Context verification
- Business state summary
- Priority surfacing

### 3. Review What Claude Surfaces

Look at:
- **Critical path status** - Where are you?
- **Blockers** - What's stuck?
- **Previous session** - Where did you leave off?
- **Recommendation** - What does Claude suggest?

### 4. Choose Your Focus

Tell Claude what you're working on:

```
Working on [specific task]
```

Claude loads relevant context and you begin.

---

## During Work

### Stay in Flow

- Let Claude track progress
- Capture decisions as they happen
- Brain dump stray thoughts
- Don't context-switch unnecessarily

### If Overwhelmed

Say:
```
Brain dump
```

Claude guides you through capturing everything, then helps you refocus.

### If Stuck

Ask:
```
What's blocking this?
```

Claude checks dependencies and suggests unblocking actions.

### If Done Early

Ask:
```
What's the next highest priority?
```

Claude surfaces the next task based on critical path.

---

## Session Duration

### Recommended Blocks

- **Deep work:** 90 minutes max
- **Break:** 10-15 minutes
- **Second block:** 60-90 minutes

### Claude's Reminders

**At 90 mins:** Gentle check-in
**At 2 hours:** Suggest break
**At 3 hours:** Strongly recommend stopping

Honor these—diminishing returns are real.

---

## End of Day (10 mins)

### 1. Wrap Current Task

If mid-task, note your exact position:

```
Stopping here: [exactly where you are]
```

### 2. End Session

```
End session
```

### 3. Review Summary

Check:
- What got done
- What's saved for tomorrow
- Any decisions made
- Files updated

### 4. Confirm Tomorrow's Priority

Claude suggests tomorrow's ONE THING. Agree or adjust:

```
Actually, tomorrow I need to [different priority]
```

---

## Quick Sessions

Not every session needs full ceremony.

### Sprint Session (30-60 mins)

```
Quick init
```

Abbreviated health check, faster start.

Then at end:
```
Quick close
```

Saves state without full summary.

### Resume Session

Continuing the same task:

```
Resume
```

Loads saved state, skips priority surfacing.

---

## Daily Note Usage

### What Goes There

- Today's plan (set during Initialize)
- Progress log (updated throughout)
- Quick captures (thoughts during work)
- End of day summary

### Auto-Created

Claude creates today's note during Initialize if missing.

### Don't Over-Engineer

The daily note is for TODAY. Don't plan weeks ahead in it.

---

## Energy-Aware Working

### Know Your Patterns

Tell Claude during Initialize:
```
Energy: High/Medium/Low today
```

### Match Work to Energy

| Energy | Good For |
|--------|----------|
| High | Deep work, decisions, creation |
| Medium | Admin, follow-ups, light tasks |
| Low | Review, reading, planning |

### Claude Will Adjust

If you say "Energy: Low" but pick a deep work task, Claude may gently challenge.

## Common Patterns

### The Productive Day

```
9:00  Initialize, choose critical path task
9:10  Deep work begins
10:30 Break
10:45 Continue or next priority
12:00 Lunch, end morning session
...
2:00  Quick init, lighter tasks
4:00  End session, plan tomorrow
```

### The Scattered Day

```
9:00  Initialize
9:05  "Actually I need to..."
9:10  Context switch
9:30  "Wait, what about..."
10:00 Brain dump (overwhelm building)
10:15 Process dump, pick ONE thing
10:20 Finally start focused work
```

The system catches scattered days and helps you refocus.

### The Recovery Day

```
9:00  Initialize
      Claude: "Brain Dump at 85% capacity"
9:05  Process brain dump
9:30  Clean backlog
10:00 Update stale files
10:30 Graph maintenance
11:00 End session (maintenance complete)
```

Sometimes the best work is system maintenance.

## What Makes It Work

1. **Consistency** - Initialize every session
2. **Honesty** - Tell Claude real status
3. **Focus** - One thing at a time
4. **Closure** - Always end sessions properly
5. **Trust** - Let the system track for you
