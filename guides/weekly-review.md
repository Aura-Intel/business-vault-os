# Weekly Review

> The Sunday ritual that keeps everything on track

---

## Why Weekly Review?

Daily work creates drift:
- Tasks get added but not prioritized
- Blockers resolve but aren't updated
- New ideas accumulate
- Focus shifts without intention

**Weekly review corrects the drift.**

---

## When to Do It

**Sunday evening** works best:
- Week is fresh in memory
- Next week is visible
- Creates clean slate for Monday

**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes

---

## The Review Protocol

### Phase 1: Process Accumulation (10 mins)

#### Brain Dump

```
Let's process the brain dump
```

Claude guides you through:
1. Review each item
2. Route to proper home (task/project/delete)
3. Clear the queue

**Target:** <10 items remaining

#### Tasks-Backlog

Review backlog for:
- Completed items not marked done
- Items no longer relevant (delete)
- Priority adjustments needed

**Target:** <30 active items

---

### Phase 2: Graph Health (10 mins)

#### Freshness Check

```
Check graph freshness
```

Look for:
- Files not updated >7 days
- Status mismatches
- Phantom blockers

#### Relationship Audit

Ask:
```
Any relationships need updating?
```

Check:
- New dependencies discovered this week
- Completed items still listed as blocking
- Missing connections

#### Update Graph Index

Make it accurate:
- Remove completed blockers
- Add new blockers
- Update status fields
- Refresh last-updated timestamp

---

### Phase 3: Week Reflection (10 mins)

#### What Got Done

Review daily notes from the week:
```
Show me this week's accomplishments
```

Capture:
- Completed tasks
- Decisions made
- Progress on critical path

#### What Didn't Happen

Be honest:
- What was planned but skipped?
- Why? (Blocked? Avoided? Deprioritized?)
- Is it still relevant?

#### Lessons Learned

Ask yourself:
- What worked well?
- What caused friction?
- What would you do differently?

Optional: Add to a Learning file

---

### Phase 4: Next Week Setup (10 mins)

#### Critical Path Check

```
Where are we on critical path?
```

Understand:
- Current position
- Next milestone
- Blockers ahead

#### Set Weekly Priorities

Choose 3-5 priorities for the week:

```markdown
## Week of [Date] Priorities

1. [Critical Path] [Top priority]
2. [High] [Second priority]
3. [Medium] [Third priority]
```

**Rule:** At least one must be on critical path.

#### Monday's ONE THING

Decide right now what Monday's focus is:

```
Monday focus: [Specific task]
```

This removes Monday morning decision fatigue.

## Common Issues

### "I don't have time"

Start with 15 minutes. Even a quick pass prevents major drift.

### "Everything feels urgent"

That's why you review. Use critical path to ruthlessly prioritize. Not everything can be #1.

### "Brain Dump is overwhelming"

You waited too long. Process mid-week next time. For now, be ruthless: delete anything >14 days old that isn't critical.

### "Nothing got done this week"

Don't judge. Ask why:
- Were priorities realistic?
- Were there hidden blockers?
- Was energy/time available?

Adjust next week accordingly.

---

## Monthly Review (Optional)

Once a month, go deeper:

### Archive Review
- Move completed projects to Archive
- Clean Tier 2 files
- Update CLAUDE.md if business changed

### System Health
- Is the vault structure working?
- Any protocols need adjustment?
- Context usage patterns

### Goal Check
- Still working toward right goal?
- Timeline realistic?
- Pivot needed?

## Making It Stick

1. **Same time each week** - Habit beats willpower
2. **Block the time** - Treat it like a meeting
3. **Don't skip** - Two skipped weeks = major drift
4. **Keep it light** - 30 mins, not 3 hours
5. **Celebrate progress** - Notice what got done
